Changelog:
----------

2011-04-02 v6.0.1 (Maurice Makaay)

    - Fixed a PHP warning:
		  Missing argument 1 for phorum_mod_automatic_timezones_addon()

2011-04-01 v6.0.0 (Maurice Makaay)

    - A full rewrite of the module, taking Joe's ideas to the next level,
      making optimal use of new features in the Phorum core.

    - Extracted logic into a separate api.php, for code clarity. The module
      code has been simplified into using only three hooks.

    - Moved the javascript code into the global Phorum javascript (still
      only triggering this code when the timezone needs to be determined).

    - The module now uses the addon hook to handle posting the offset
      from the client to the module. The redirection code has been improved,
      to not have to fiddle with the active URL to include the offset in
      the request (which could cause issues with systems that use their own
      URL formatting schema for things like friendly URLs or embedding Phorum).

    - New offset caching mechanism, to minimize local impact:
      - When cookie storage is available for the client, then no local caching
        of offsets is done anymore.
      - When cookie storage is unavailable, then registered users will have
        their offset stored in the user's settings data. For unregistered
        users, the offset is cached based on the IP address of the user.
      - Keeping the IP-cache limited (to prevent db storage overflow) has
        been optimized to not delete all entries on overflow, but only
        to trim down the cache to 80% of the maximum allowed storage.

    - Fixed some buggy behavior that showed for users that configured their
      own timezone in the Control Center (when saving settings, the selected
      time zone was stored, but the settings panel would show the
      automatically determined time zone instead).

    - Fixed the bug that caused the PHP Notice "Undefined index: REMOTE_ADDR
      in .../automatic_timezones.php on line 79" when executing the
      script.php.

2009-04-02 v5.2.1.05 (Joe Curia)

    - Enhancement: Module rewritten to place the necessary javascript inside the
      header.  This allows for browsers without javascript to view the page 
      without any negative consequences without the need for the excessive 
      browscap support.  Thanks go to Phorum developer Maurice Makaay for 
      pointing me in the right direction on this.

2009-03-28 v5.2.1.04 (Joe Curia)

    - Bugfix: Previous coding required the user's browser to support javascript.
      To work around this, the module now checks if the user's browser is 
      capable of supporting javacript before running.  If the user has disabled 
      javascript, a meta refresh will kick in after 2 seconds the first time 
      they visit the forum.  After that their IP Address will be cached.
      Thanks go to Phorum user didi2 for reporting this bug.

    - Bugfix: Eliminated some PHP notices.

2009-02-04 v5.2.1.03 (Joe Curia)

    - Bugfix: Users in the GMT time zone (i.e. 0 offset) would experience an 
      infinite loop.  Thanks go to Phorum user ExIslander for reporting this 
      bug.

2008-12-15 v5.2.1.02 (Joe Curia)

    - Enhancement: Added support for the Recent Messages module and other 
      modules which might call the phorum_api_user_save() function before 
      displaying dates.

2008-10-22 v5.2.1.01 (Joe Curia)

    - Bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused the cc_panel hook in other modules to 
      fail.  Thank you Maurice Makaay for this fix.

2008-10-20 v5.2.1.00 (Joe Curia)

    - Started.
