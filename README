Module  : Automatic Time Zones
Version : 6.0.1
Authors : Original idea and implementation by Joe Curia
          Full rewrite by Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module tries to automatically detect the visitor's time zone (using
JavaScript) and adjusts the times shown in your forum accordingly. This will
work for both logged in and anonymous users.

By default, all time zone offests will be automatically determined by the
time zone offset on the visitor's computer.
For authenticated users and anonymous users that have cookies enabled in
their browser, the time zone will be checked once per day.
If an anonymous visitor does not have cookies enabled, that visitor's IP
address will be stored with the offset information. In this case the time
zone will be checked every two hours to avoid issues with dynamic and/or
roaming IP's.

In the settings page, the admin can allow registered users to override the 
automatic timezone with one of there own choosing. To use this option, you 
must enable the option "Allow Time Zone Selection" in the User Settings 
section of the General Settings page in the admin section as well.
